# FunkPd Screenshot Pro

**FunkPd Screenshot Pro** is a browser-based visual QA tool that captures every page from a websiteâ€™s sitemap and turns them into a scrollable gallery.

Built for **developers and designers**, it makes regression checks fast after plugin updates, CSS changes, or redesigns: no installs, servers, or uploads.

Use it to:
- Visually scan an entire site for layout breaks or style regressions  
- Compare before/after changes  
- Export a single-PDF review set for client feedback

**Free Light Demo:** runs entirely in your browser.  
**Pro Version ($10/mo):** adds full-res captures, cookie sessions, and PDF export.
